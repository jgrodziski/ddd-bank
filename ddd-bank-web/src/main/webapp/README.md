Version 0.9.1 RC

The Gist
========

<a href="https://github.com/ajkochanowicz/Kickstrap/issues/16">To do for v 1.0 stable</a>

Kickstrap uses the latest version of Twitter's bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) and adds a layer of extras to create slick web applications with themes, modern html/css standards, an icon font, and progressive enhancement through javascript.

Last updated with Bootstrap v. 2.03

The Extras
==========

**<a href="http://daneden.me/animate/">Animate.css</a>**

+ "Just add water" CSS animations.

**<a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/#">Font Awesome</a> + <a href="http://keyamoon.com/icomoon/">IcoMoon</a>**

+ Turns glyphicons into an icon font to use a variety of sizes and colors. Also adds a bunch of new icons from FontAwesome and IcoMoon.

**<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> Goodies**

Uses sample files and resources gathered and created from HTML5 Boilerplate for making great HTML5 pages. Bootstrap Extra includes a sample file ready to go for a new Bootstrap HTML5 Page.

+ Normalized, jQueryized, Doctypized html starter files.
+ Modernizr js loaded and ready to go in starter html files.
+ Ready for Google Analytics
+ Optional Google Chrome Frame prompt for users of older browsers
+ Too much to mention here. More information at <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">H5BP Homepage</a>

**New javascript plugins**

+ <a href="http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/">Chosen</a>, a jQuery-powered library to stylize &lt;select&gt; boxes. (See sample.html)
+ <a href="http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jGrowl">jGrowl</a>, a Growl-like notification system for websites.

**Themes**

+ Easily switch to different color schemes.
+ Support for <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> themes. Easily switch between predefined theme packages.

**<a href="http://adamkochanowicz.com/oneline.html">One Line CSS Grid</a>**

+ OLCG is just a 98 byte code snippet to quickly halve or third anything.
+ (.oh = one half, ot = one third, tt = two thirds.)
+ Check out the docs to see how much this little piece of code can do.

**Some IE6 Compatibility**

+ I know, I know. But there are still some sites with specialized circles of clients whose users base is significantly IE6 reliant.
+ Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/empowering-communities/Bootstrap-IE6">Sharry Stowell's IE6 css/js for Bootstrap</a>, Kickstrap will display significantly better in IE6 than plain Bootstrap. 
+ Only IE7- users will download the small, additional css and js.

Quick Start
===========

Install
-------

+ If you're starting from scratch, simply download this repository and start working in the index.html or sample_index.html document.
+ If you already have a Bootstrap installation running, drop the /extras folder into your Bootstrap root. Drag the sample_index.html file in /extras to your Bootstrap root and /extras/css/bootstrap(.min).css wherever you have your existing bootstrap.css file. It should be linked and ready to go.
(If you already have HTML files you want to use, see "Advanced Setup" below.

Pick Theme
----------

*LESS compiler required, <a href="https://github.com/ajkochanowicz/Kickstrap/wiki/Windows">Windows users should do this.</a>

1. Open /extras/themes/settings.less and uncomment the @import line (remove the //s) of the theme you want to use.
2. Compile.

Advanced Setup
==============

In the future, I plan to have a customized download replace the need for "Advanced Setup".

Install
-------

1. If you already have html (or php, aspx...) files you want to use, drop the /extras folder in your Bootstrap root. Paste this into the head of every page you want to use Kickstrap:
<pre>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/bootstrap.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;extras/html5bp/js/libs/modernizr-2.5.3.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
(Assuming this file is in the Bootstrap root directory. Adjust accordingly.)
2. Add the following just before the ending &lt;body&gt; tag:
<pre>&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;window.jQuery || document.write('&lt;script src=&quot;extras/h5bp/js/libs/jquery-1.7.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;')&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;extras/chosen/chosen.jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var _gaq=[['_setAccount','UA-XXXXX-X'],['_trackPageview']];
  (function(d,t){var g=d.createElement(t),s=d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];
  g.src=('https:'==location.protocol?'//ssl':'//www')+'.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
  s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s)}(document,'script'));
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
(Assuming this file is in your root bootstrap directory. Adjust accordingly.)
3. Add this to the end of the /less/bootstrap.less file:
<code>@import "../extras/settings/overrides.less";<code>
4. Choose your theme in /extras/themes/settings.less (uncomment the @import line you want to use) and compile.

Optional: If you're using your own existing Bootstrap installation and really don't want to replace bootstrap.css (say you've customized it),
remember to include the chosen library with the following lines of code near your ending body tag:

<pre>&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;extras/css/chosen.min.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; $(&quot;.chzn-select&quot;).chosen(); $(&quot;.chzn-select-deselect&quot;).chosen({allow_single_deselect:true}); &lt;/script&gt;</pre>

Pick Theme
----------

If using the included index.html file, you can follow the instructions in "Quick Setup" above.
